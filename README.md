# queues

This repository is a project from Princeton's Algorithms class. The aim of the assignment is to create deque and randomized queue data structures after learning the implementation and functionality of stack and queue data structures. To implement a deque data structure, which can add or remove from either the front or back, two pointers from each node had to be kept which pointed to the previous and next node in the deque, as well as a pointer to the first node in the deque and a pointer to the last node in the deque. The randomized queue data struture was implmented like a regular queue for adding elements, however, removing elements was done using a pseudo-random method to randomly pick an element to remove from the queue. The repository contains code for the two data structures within the src folder as well as files for testing the functionality of the program.
